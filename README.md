# fridgy-iOS
Fridge Organiser iOS App

## Description

Fridgy is a fridge organiser. An issue with a lot of fridge organisers that I have seen is that they require a lot of micro-management - the user has to update the app every time they open their fridge. Items in the Fridgy list can only have one of three states: in stock, running low, or empty, all of which are controlled with simple swipe actions.

Fridgy will also be able to generate shopping lists based on what's missing from your fridge. When adding an item, there's the option to favourite it. On generating the shopping list, it will be populated with all favourited items that are marked as running low or empty. Other items can be added by the user too.

## Future Work
- Expiry date is clunky to input, so also having the option to enter just days will help
- A default value of a week here would help too
- Add Shopping List button - this creates a list of all of the items you have favourited that are either running low or have run out.
  - Other items can be added to the shopping list
  - Each item in the list will have a checkbox to indicate whether it has been purchased
  - All of the selected items can be re-added to your fridge with one button
  - Shelf life of items will be saved when they are first entered for quick expiry autofill here
- Add tabs to display different locations i.e pantry, fridge freezer
- Add select mode, which gives a selectable table of all items across the tabs
  - Here can mass-delete or -favourite
  - Can generate a google search of recipes for the selected items
- Add tag groups which are colour coded
  - Assigned in select mode
  - Groups favourited items in the shopping list (e.g dairy, meat)
- Barcode scanner will save a lot of time when entering items
